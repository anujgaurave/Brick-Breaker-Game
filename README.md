# Brick-Breaker-Game

I created a Brick Breaker game in Java using Swing for graphics. It featured a bouncing ball, a movable paddle, and destructible bricks. Players could keep track of their score and the game had clear win and lose states, allowing for restarts. I aimed for smooth gameplay, responsive controls, and a visually appealing design to offer an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience
